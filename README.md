# neural-network-image-classifier
Neural network for image classification using PyTorch

**Grayscale Images**: Each image is a single channel (grayscale) and has a size of 28x28 pixels.

**Labels**: Each image comes with a label (an integer between 0 and 9) representing the digit in the image.

**Normalization**: The images are typically normalized to have pixel values in the range [0, 1] or standardized with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


## Training set: 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Test set: 10,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

Each image is 28x28 pixels in size.
